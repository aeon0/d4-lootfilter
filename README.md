Filter items in your inventory based on affixes, aspects and thresholds of their values. For questions, feature request or issue reports join the [discord](https://discord.gg/4rG6yD3dnD) or use github issues.

@Blizzard, please dont take this away from us. I can not bear to look at another affix...

## Features
- Filter items in inventory and if chest is open also in chest tabs (can be configured which ones)
- Filter by item type and item power
- Filter by affix and thresholds of their values
- Filter by aspects and threshold of their values
- Mark everything that does not pass the filter as junk

## Getting Started

### Game Settings
- Supported resolutions: 1920x1080, 2560x1440, 3840x2160
- Font size must be set to small in the Gameplay Settings
- Game Language must be English
- Advanced Tooltip Information (showing min and max values) is fine. But the Compare has to be truned off

### Run
- Execute d4lf.exe and go to your D4 screen.
- There is a small overlay on the center bottom with buttons:
  - toggle: Make the console visiable or hide it
  - filter: Start filtering items
  - scripts: In case there are any scripts attached, run them
- Alternative use the hotkeys. e.g. f11 for filtering
- All items that do not match any of your filter configs will be marked as junk.

Note: Make sure to only have items in your inventory. For example elixirs (seen as magic) or material (seen as common) will be marked as junk!

### Configs
The config folder contains:
- __filter_aspects.yaml__: Filter settings for aspects.
- __filter_affixes.yaml__: Filter settings for affixes.
- __params.ini__: Different hotkey settings and number of chest stashes that should be looked at.
- __game.ini__: Settings regarding color thresholds and image positions. You dont need to touch this.

## How to filter
### Aspects
In [config/filter_aspects.yaml](config/filter_aspects.yaml) any aspects can be added in the format of `[ASPECT_KEY, THRESHOLD, CONDITION]`. The condition can be any of `[larger, smaller]` and defaults to `larger` if no value is given.

For example:
```yaml
Aspects:
    # Filter for a perfect umbral
    - [aspect_of_the_umbral, 4]
    # Filter for any umbral
    - aspect_of_the_umbral
```
Aspect keys are lower case and spaces are replaced by underscore. You can find the full list of keys in [assets/aspect.json](assets/aspects.json). If Aspects is empty, all legendary items will be kept.

### Affixes
Affixes have the same structure of `[AFFIX_KEY, THRESHOLD, CONDITION]` as described above and are added to [config/filter_affixes.yaml](config/filter_affixes.yaml). Additionally, it can be filtered by `itemType`, `minPower` and `minAffixCount`. See the list of affix keys in [assets/affixes.json](assets/affixes.json). Uniques are by default always kept while Magic and Common items are discarded as junk by default.

```yaml
Filters:
  # Search for armor and pants that have at least 3 affixes of the affixPool
  - Armor:
      itemType: [armor, pants]
      minPower: 725
      affixPool:
        - [damage_reduction_from_close_enemies, 10]
        - [damage_reduction_from_distant_enemies, 12]
        - [damage_reduction, 5]
        - [total_armor, 9]
        - [maximum_life, 700]
      minAffixCount: 3
```

Note: If an itemType is not included in your filters, all items of this type will be discarded as junk! There is an example of a "TakeAll" filter in the filter_affixes.yaml. To keep an item type regardless of affixes and itemPower, add it there.

## Develop

### Python Setup
- Install [miniconda](https://docs.conda.io/projects/miniconda/en/latest/)
```bash
git clone https://github.com/aeon0/d4lf
cd d4lf
conda env create environment.yaml
conda activate d4lf
python src/main.py
```

### Linting
The CI will fail if the linter would change any files. You can run linting with:
```bash
conda activate d4lf
black .
```
To ignore certain code parts from formatting
```python
# fmt: off
# ...
# fmt: on

# fmt: skip
# ...
```
Setup VS Code by using the black formater extension. Also turn on "trim trailing whitespaces" is VS Code settings.
